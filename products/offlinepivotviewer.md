The **Offline PivotViewer** is a prototype desktop application that hosts the [Silverlight PivotViewer control][ag-pv] in an embedded browser, fed by an embedded web server to proxy requests to destinations not otherwise available to Silverlight applications (i.e. the local file system), thus replacing the defunct Live Labs Pivot for collection browsing and debugging.

It also features the ability to browse a ZIP file of collections, for easy offline browsing of related collections.  You can try it with [Photography.zip], which contains Pivot collection prototypes of the content at [http://photo.stackexchange.com/][photo-se]
